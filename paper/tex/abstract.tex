Currently there are almost no video games that include real-time animated clouds. Many games don't value full-blown weather-pattern visuals because they don't add as much to the user's experience as other features. 
Additionally, creating a simulated weather system can become computationally expensive, and that compute time could be better spent for other game features. 

Because of this, many game titles opt to visualize the sky or clouds with simple textures and billboards. 
Most of the time these are static visuals that may be combined with cheap blending tricks to add a loose dimension of animation.

We propose a wholistic method to cheaply generate animated, realstic clouds in real-time. Our clouds require no precomputation or preprocessing. 
There is not even any traditional post-processing required for our clouds. Using 3D textures, 3D noise generation, and voxel cone tracing, our fully parameterized clouds can be utilized in many applications spanning from video games to physics-based weather simulations.
